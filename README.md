# ffmpegAutoConvert
Small script to automatically convert video files using ffmpeg.

## How to Use:
The script expects exactly two directories as arguments. The first being the input directory (where the files you want to convert are located), the second being the output directory (where the converted files will be placed).
Like so: 
> ffmpegAutoConvert /path/to/input/dir /path/to/output/dir
