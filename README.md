# ffmpegAutoConvert
Small script to automatically convert all video files in a directory using ffmpeg. By default it converts everything to a widely playable format i.e. an h264 mp4 with stereo aac audio.

## How to Use:
The script expects exactly two directories as arguments. The first being the input directory (where the files you want to convert are located), the second being the output directory (where the converted files will be placed).
Like so: 
> ffmpegAutoConvert /path/to/input/dir /path/to/output/dir
